# Password Generator

This was an assignment given by the UT Coding Bootcamp.  I was tasked to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
